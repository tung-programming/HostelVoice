- **Mess feedback ignored** without proper collection mechanisms
- **Caretakers overwhelmed** with unorganized student requests
- **Admins lack visibility** into hostel operations and metrics

### Architecture Pattern: Backend-First Design

```
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
|                  |         |                  |         |                  |
|   Next.js 16     |  HTTP   |   Express.js     |  Admin  |    Supabase      |
|   Frontend       +-------->+   Backend API    +-------->+   PostgreSQL     |
|   (Port 3000)    |  REST   |   (Port 3001)    |  Client |    Database      |
|                  |<--------+                  |<--------+                  |
+--------+---------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
         |                            |
         | Auth Only                  | All Data Ops
         |                            | + Audit Logs
         |                            | + Notifications
         v                            |
   Supabase Auth                      |
   (Login/Register)                   |
         +----------------------------+
```

**Why Backend-First?**
- ✅ Centralized business logic
- ✅ Consistent authorization checks
- ✅ Complete audit trail of all actions
- ✅ Frontend never directly accesses database
- ✅ Easier to maintain and scale

## 🚦 User Journey Flows

### 1️⃣ Registration & Approval Flow

        |
        +---> User record created ---> approval_status = 'pending'
        |
        +---> Admin sees approval request ---> Reviews & Approves/Rejects
        |
        +---> Approved ---> User can access dashboard
              Rejected ---> Access denied with reason
```

        |      priority, location)              |
        |                                       +---> Assigns to staff
        +---> Submits via API                   |
        |                                       +---> Updates status
        +---> Gets notification                 |     (open -> in_progress -> resolved)
        |     on status changes                 |
        |                                       +---> Issue resolved -> Student notified
